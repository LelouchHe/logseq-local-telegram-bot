## Local Telegram Bot

This is the repo for a Logseq plugin that handles user requests to a Telegram bot. It's designed to be used as another way to use Logseq from mobile, when existing sync is not available yet for non-iCloud users.

It handles different commands, helps update Graph database and send notification when deadline is near, and many more.
