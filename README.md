## Local Telegram Bot

This is the repo for a Logseq plugin that handles user requests to a Telegram bot. It's designed to be used as another way to use Logseq from mobile, when existing sync is not available yet for non-iCloud users.

It handles different commands, helps update Graph database and send notification when deadline is near, and many more.

## Current features

1. Send text and photo to Logseg
2. Page and Inbox can be changed

## Future features

1. Fetch page/block
2. Send TODO notification

## Thanks
